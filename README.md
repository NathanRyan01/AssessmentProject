This project is an Android application. This application then takes two requests via the user interface. 

It will send a request to an API to either return all records or else one specific record. 

Once the record/s are returned, the user can select the record for further information. 

Either a description or a "No description available" message will be presented depending on what data is returned.

Validation is added for null values, records that dont exist and various other issues.
